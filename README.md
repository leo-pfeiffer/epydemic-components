# epydemic-components

`lab_df.py` contains the LabDataFrame class, which can be used to transform
a common epydemic data frame.

`components/` contains the available plotly components

`tests/` ... self-explanatory

So far implemented:
- LabDataFrame class as a wrapper to get the lab dataframe into the right format
- Started on components library

Todo:
- Finish a working example with the compartment curve graph
- Create a unified way of handling layout, etc...
